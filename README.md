# BellyButton

## Overview of Project
Roza provided a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. But needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer.

### Purpose
The purpose is to be able to allow her volunteers to be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly button. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
